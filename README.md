FastAPI + LLM Application – Movies & Universities Generator

Welcome to the FastAPI + LLM-powered Movies & Universities Recommendation App!
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a production-ready web application using FastAPI, HTML templates, LLM integration (ChatGroq), Docker, and CI/CD deployment on Render.

The application provides two interactive sections:

🎬 Movies Generator

🎓 Universities Information Generator

Users can select either option and receive AI-generated responses powered by an LLM.

📁 Project Setup & Repository Initialization
Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

Created a new GitHub repository with:

README.md

.gitignore

LICENSE

Cloned the repository to the local machine.

Step 2: Open Project in VS Code

Opened the cloned repository using PowerShell:

code .

Step 3: Dependency Configuration

Created requirements.txt to list all standard and third-party dependencies required for the project.

🧩 Virtual Environment & Dependency Management (uv)
Step 4: Initialize Virtual Environment
uv init

Step 5: Add Dependencies

Installed required packages into the uv-managed environment:

uv add <packages>

Step 6: Install Local Packages

Installed local modules in editable mode:

uv pip install -e .


This ensures seamless imports across the project.

🔐 Environment Variables & LLM Configuration
Step 7: Environment Variable Setup

Created a .env file.

Added the LLM API key for ChatGroq.

Example:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Loaded the variables in the application using:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

⚙️ FastAPI Application & Routing Logic
Step 8: Main Application File

Created app_fastapi.py, which acts as the entry point of the application.

Responsibilities:

Handles user navigation and routing

Loads HTML templates

Directs users to:

🎬 Movies page

🎓 Universities page

When users access the Render URL, they land on a homepage with both options.

Step 9: Application Flow

User selects Movies or Universities

FastAPI routes the request to the corresponding form

LLM generates results using ChatGroq

Output is rendered back to the user via HTML templates

🎨 Frontend (HTML Templates & Static Assets)
Step 10: UI Structure

Added the following directories:

static/
templates/

Step 11: HTML Pages

Three HTML files were created:

index.html → Landing page

movies.html → Movies form & results

universities.html → Universities form & results

These pages provide a clean, user-friendly interface without opening additional ports.

🧪 Streamlit Experiment (Optional)
Step 12: Streamlit Limitation

Initially attempted to use Streamlit for Movies and Universities pages.

⚠️ Limitation:

Streamlit runs on a separate port

Render does not support multiple exposed ports

📌 Solution:

Streamlit files (Movies.py, University.py) are retained in the repository

Can be used in cloud platforms like AWS

Requires a separate index.html to integrate properly

🤖 LLM Integration (ChatGroq)
Step 13: LLM Usage

Integrated ChatGroq API

Currently using:

llama-3.3-70b-versatile


(Free model)

🔁 To switch models:

Update model name in code

Add corresponding API key in .env

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline – Docker, GitHub Actions & Render
Step 14: CI/CD Setup

Configured deployment files:

Dockerfile

.dockerignore

.github/workflows/

render.yaml

render-run.yaml

Step 15: GitHub Secrets

Created a GitHub Actions secret:

RENDER_API_KEY


Used to authenticate and deploy to Render.

Step 16: Dockerization

Built a Docker image for the FastAPI application

Ensured production-ready containerization

Step 17: CI/CD Execution

Pushed updated code to GitHub

GitHub Actions automatically:

Built Docker image

Pushed image to Render

Triggered deployment

🌐 Render Deployment
Step 18: Deployment Monitoring

Logged into Render Dashboard

Navigated to Workbench

Viewed active deployment

Live URL generated by Render:
👉 https://fastapi-streamlit-with-llm-1.onrender.com

🧪 Application Usage
Step 19: Test the Application

Open the live URL

Select Movies or Universities

Provide inputs

Receive AI-generated responses instantly
